I'm Abhishek Naidu 👨🏽‍💻 currently, a frontend developer at @CRED-Dev, previously, interned at @fampay, @iconscout, @creativecommons and @IITH , also I'm a crypto enthusiast, open-source contributor. I mainly code in JavaScript.

I am currently working on a couple of both Web2 and Web3 open-source projects. I'm also a project collaborator and community team member at @creativecommons and been a GSoC Mentor too. Majorly contributed to creative commons's search engine called cc search, which is an interface to search for content that is licensed under creative commons licenses or in the public domain.

Any funds I receive from the Github Sponsors ❤️, Surely gonna help me to boost myself and gives me great motivation 💪🏽 and I can relentlessly maintain my projects and contribute to the open-source community.

I like to work on:

⚛️ Next.js and React.js

🌐 Web-Development [HTML, CSS and JavaScript]

🛠 Firebase, MongoDB, MySQL

🐍 Python and Pytorch [Deep-Learning Framework]

💻 Node.js and PHP

🕸️ GraphQL and REST API

🐙 Git and GitHub

➡️ Developer workflows

If you sponsor me you'll always be the first to know about anything new I'm working on through the email updates I send to my sponsors. You'll also always have early access to anything new I build. The higher sponsor tiers also get their company name with a logo in my thanks page with varied sizes.

Thanks a lot for your support! ❤️
